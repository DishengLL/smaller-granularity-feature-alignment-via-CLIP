> `Generalizability`: Moreover, the labeling of medical images is usually expensive and time-consuming, especially for the study of image data from multiple imaging centers with diferent machines and equipment, which leads to migration of image distribution due to the diferences in scanning protocols, shooting parameters and angles, and subject groups.
